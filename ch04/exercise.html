        <p id="box1">“However, as we approach the 29 March deadline, the market is beginning to respond to the UK’s
            decision to leave
            the EU. We’ve already seen indications that prices in London and the South East are beginning to dip, which
            is
            likely to continue as buyers finally let their pre-Brexit jitters play out.”<br>

            Jonathan explained whatever the outcome with Theresa May’s Brexit deal, either direction will likely see a
            slowing of the market.<br>

            He continued: “There are still two routes we can take when it comes to Brexit – deal or no deal – and each
            of
            these could have a different impact on the housing market.<br>
            “In either scenario, what we are likely to see after March is a slowing of the market in other areas of the
            country, as London and the South East often lead the way when it comes to house price trends.<br></p>
        <p id="box2">“However, I don’t anticipate any kind of immediate large-scale fall in prices – more a softening
            of the market
            as buyers hold their collective breath. The transition period, from March to December 2020, is key here.”<br>

            Jonathan also explained how it’s more likely other economic factors would have an influence on house
            prices, as
            opposed to Brexit alone.<br>

            “As we slowly disengage from the EU, it’s possible that wider economic factors could influence house
            prices, with key trade deals (for example) impacting on house buyers’ general sense of confidence.”<br>

            We are likely to see a temporary drop in the pound, which could spur foreign investment in the housing
            market which Jonathan claims could keep the market steady until UK buyers’ confidence is increased.<br></p>
