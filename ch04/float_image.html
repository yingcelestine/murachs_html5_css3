        London (CNN)An influential cross-party group of MPs is moving to wrest the initiative over the Brexit process
        from UK Prime Minister Theresa May. CNN has learned that they are planning to introduce legislation on Monday
        that would scupper the government's Withdrawal Bill and block a "no-deal" Brexit.
        The word in the Westminster corridors Friday was that this unprecedented cross-party "insurgency" was gaining
        strength. The government's "Plan B" -- which is due to be set out on Monday and debated in the House of Commons
        the following week -- would be rendered null and void if the MPs legislation were passed.
        Among the MPs behind the measure is the Conservative Nick Boles and Labour's Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn.
        However, they and other supporters of the legislation will need to work with the Speaker of the House to get
        parliamentary time for their proposal.
        Why the Brexit deadlock cannot be broken
        A critical part of the bill -- dubbed European Withdrawal 3.0 -- would postpone the UK's departure from the
        European Union on March 29 if parliament fails to agree on a way forward by then. That is the day on which
        Article 50 -- the timetable for the UK's withdrawal -- expires. Any extension would have to be agreed by the
        other 27 members of the EU.
        According to a research paper just published by the House of Commons library, the bill means that "the
        government would be compelled to request an extension of the two-year negotiating period under Article 50." It
        says "the drafters of the Bill specifically contemplate an extension of just over 9 months, from 29 March 2019
        to 31 December 2019."
        The government has insisted that the threat of a "no deal" Brexit is an important element in its negotiating
        strategy with the European Union. Prime Minister Theresa May has consistently ruled out an extension of Article
        50, though many commentators believe there isn't enough time for parliament to pass the necessary legislation
        to give effect to withdrawal by the end of March.
        According to the leaked transcript of a conference call, the British Chancellor or Finance Minister, Philip
        Hammond, told business leaders last week that the MPs' initiative would be "a sort of ultimate backstop if the
        work the government is doing in seeking to find a way forward fails to deliver."
